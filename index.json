[{"content":"Introduction This box makes use of sql injection, but not in the way that people normally expect. The box hosts a few different webpages, with one of them being vulnerable to NoSQL injection. The NoSQL injection can be used to harvest user credentials, one of which can be used to ssh into the machine as the mango user. From there, we can login as the admin user with su, and use the jjs SUID binary on the machine to spawn a reverse shell as root.\nEnumeration Nmap # Nmap 7.92 scan initiated Fri Aug 5 15:56:07 2022 as: nmap -sS -sCV -oA scans/nmap/init -Pn 10.10.10.162 Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.162 Host is up (0.022s latency).

Using gobuster to scan for additional subdomains does not lead to any more results.\nNavigating to http://mango.htb gives a 403 forbidden message, so this is a dead end.\nhttps://mango.htb does, however, load properly. It brings up what looks like a simple websearch, but id does not do anything when a search is made. Checking https://staging-order.mango.htb brings up the same webpage.\nRunning gobuster on the https website shows an endpoint for http://mango.htb/analytics.php.\nThe analytics page itself, does not load any data, since the required license has expired. So this is another dead end.\nhttp://staging-order.mango.htb brings up a login page that does not seem to change on failed login. Probably it is just not showing a proper message to let us know if the login was successful.\nShell as Mango NoSQL Injection Running sqlmap on the login page does not show any fields that are vulnerable to SQL injection. However, NoSQL injection does work, and allows us to bypass authentication.\nPayloadAllTheThings provides all the common NoSQL injection tricks. Intercepting the login request with Burpsuite and putting [$ne] after each POST parameter bypasses login.\nSuccessful login redirects to home.php, which is a placeholder page for a future project\nWhile the actual contents of home.php are not useful, we can still use the NoSQL injection to gather valid user credentials.

From there, we can grab the ftp users ssh key from the ftp share and ssh into the machine. The ftp user is allowed to run a script as sudo that opens a pdb instance on an exception.

However, after initial access, the app becomes a great source of system enumeration from the chat logs, as well as being able to be used to privesc to root. The initial access is gained from a subdomain hosting an incomplete CRUD app for managing an inventory of pets that has the .git directory publicly available. With access to the git folder, we can get the source for the web app and discover a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited with Burpsuite. Initial access as Patrick allows us to read his chat logs, revealing an Influxdb instance is running that is vulnerable to an authentication bypass. The database contains credentials for another user, Catherine, who we are then able to login as. Catherine\u0026rsquo;s chat log reveals there is a development version of the chat app running on port 8443, and there is a backup file on the system. Analysis of the backed up files shows we can use app on port 8443 to read files as root. We can then read roots ssh key to login as root.\nEnumeration Nmap From the nmap results, we can see that this is a webserver with an unidentified app on port 8000.

This is done to avoid messing up the payload with special characters like \u0026quot; or '.\nFrom there, we can grab Patrick\u0026rsquo;s ssh key for a better shell experience\nShell as Catherine Interesting Ports After running linpeas, we can see that there are some ports that are open locally that we could not previously access\nRight now, we do not know what these ports do, so we will look around some more.\nPatrick Chat Log We can see Patrick\u0026rsquo;s chat log in the chat app by logging into it while logged into the machine as Patrick\nLooking up info on Influxdb shows that it runs on port 8086 by default, and is thus likely what we saw earlier in linpeas. We can check the version of Influxdb running by making a HEAD request with curl on port 8086\nLooking up \u0026ldquo;Influxdb 1.7.5\u0026rdquo; on google shows results for CVE-2019-20933\nWith this exploit, we can bypass authentication and gain access to the database as an admin. We need to port forward with ssh in order to access the database on our machine.\nssh -L 8086:127.0.0.1:8086 patrick@10.10.11.118 -i patrick_id_rsa.\nFrom there, we can dump the data from the users table\nThis reveals a few users and their passwords, but Catherine sticks out because that is a user on the box. Attempting to use this password to switch users to Catherine is successful\nShell as Root Now that we are Catherine, lets examine her chat log like we did for Patrick.\nThe chat log mentions the development version of the chat app is up on port 8443, and the source code is in a backup file. Checking in /var/backup we find archives of the development and main version.\nExtracting and checking the this version of the code shows a new command file has been added that allows reading files on the system. A password is required, but it is hardcoded into the app, so we can just read it. Since this program is running as root, we can read roots ssh key\nThen we can just ssh as root\n","permalink":"https://TMDeal.github.io/htb/devzat/","summary":"Writeup for the Devzat lab machine on HackTheBox","title":"HackTheBox - Devzat"}]
